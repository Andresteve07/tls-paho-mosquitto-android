Paho Android MQTT(Mosquitto) with SSL/TLS

This is my small customized version of the eclipse's paho app for mqtt protocol

You can use this app after the mosquitto broker server setup first.

Following my another github for setting up the mosquitto broker server and testing if you don't have any of it.

It won't compile if you don't download the openssl java library like bouncycastle from the site
